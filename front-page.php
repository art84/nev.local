                <div class="text1">
                    <p>The courier industry has typically been terrible. Think about every<br>
                        courier experience you have had. You never know who is delivering<br>
                        your goods, or when they will be delivered. Same Day Express<br>
                        changes this.

                <div class="text2">
                    <p>When you place your booking with Same Day Express it uses the technology<br>
                        from Zoom2u. The booking will automatically be dispatched to the closest<br>
                        courier. Once your booking is linked to a courier (usually less than 5mins) you<br>
                        will receive a notification. You'll receive details on who the courier is, their contact<br>
                        number (allowing you to call or SMS) and the ability to track their location. You<br>
                        will no longer need to wonder where your courier is and how long until they arrive.<br>
